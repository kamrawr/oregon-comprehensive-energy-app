## üîß Technical Debt / Known Issues

1. **MVP index.html has hard-coded data**
   - Need to refactor to load from config/data files
   - Currently uses embedded JavaScript objects

2. **No YAML parser in browser**
   - Options:
     - Convert YAML to JSON at build time
     - Use js-yaml library (adds ~100KB)
     - Keep config in YAML for maintenance, distribute as JSON
   - **Recommended:** Use build script to convert YAML ‚Üí JSON

3. **Chart.js CDN dependency**
   - Currently used but not essential
   - Could remove to keep fully offline-capable
   - Alternative: Use Canvas API directly for simple charts

4. **No validation library**
   - All validation currently hand-coded
   - Consider: Joi, Yup, or Zod for schema validation
   - **Recommended:** Stick with manual validation to avoid dependencies
