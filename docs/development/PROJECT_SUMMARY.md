# Oregon Comprehensive Energy Assessment - Project Summary

## ✅ What Was Built

A complete, single-page web application that integrates four major modules:

### 1. Customer Intake Module
- Contact information capture (name, email, phone)
- Geographic eligibility (36 Oregon counties with specific AMI data)
- Utility provider selection (PGE, Pacific Power, NW Natural, etc.)
- Housing type and ownership status
- Priority needs assessment (multi-select concerns)
- Urgency rating
- **Auto-generates unique Customer ID** for tracking

### 2. Income Qualification Module
- Household size input (1-8 people)
- Flexible income entry (annual/monthly/biweekly/weekly)
- Pre-tax vs. post-tax income handling with automatic gross-up
- Real-time calculation of:
  - % of Area Median Income (county-specific, household-adjusted)
  - % of State Median Income (Oregon SMI = $78,600)
  - % of Federal Poverty Level (2025 HHS guidelines)
- **Automatic eligibility determination** for:
  - LIHEAP (≤150% FPL)
  - Weatherization (≤60% SMI)
  - Energy Trust Income-Qualified (≤80% AMI)
  - Low-Income Housing (≤80% AMI)
  - First-Time Homebuyer (≤120% AMI)
  - Standard programs

### 3. Home Energy Assessment Module
- Property details (square footage, foundation, roof)
- Building envelope evaluation (attic/wall insulation, windows, doors)
- HVAC systems assessment (heating/cooling type, age, ductwork)
- Health & safety checklist (combustion, moisture, mold, asbestos, lead)
- **Smart recommendations engine** that:
  - Prioritizes health & safety first
  - Calculates measure-specific costs and incentives
  - Considers dependencies (e.g., roof before attic)
  - Sizes HVAC based on conditioned space
  - Estimates insulation square footage

### 4. Incentive Insights & Pathways Module
- **Synthesizes all previous data** into personalized plan
- Shows different pathways based on income eligibility:
  - Weatherization-eligible: Low/no-cost options highlighted
  - Income-qualified: Enhanced incentive packages
  - Standard: Full incentive breakdown
- Prioritized retrofit plan table with adjusted net costs
- Contact resources (phone numbers, websites)
- Reflects customer's stated concerns from intake
- **Downloadable HTML report** with all details

## 🎨 Design Features

- **Modern, clean UI** with gradient backgrounds and glassmorphism effects
- **Progress tracker** showing 4-step workflow with visual indicators
- **Responsive design** - works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Smooth animations** and transitions between steps
- **Color-coded badges** for eligibility status
- **Interactive tables** with hover effects
- **Professional styling** matching energy/sustainability branding

## 📊 Data Accuracy

All embedded data is current as of 2025:
- **36 Oregon counties** with specific AMI values (Baker: $55,800 → Washington: $98,200)
- **2025 Federal Poverty Guidelines** for household sizes 1-8
- **Oregon SMI:** $78,600 (4-person baseline)
- **Household adjustments:** Proper HUD multipliers (1-person: 0.70 → 8-person: 1.32)
- **Energy Trust incentive rates:**
  - Attic insulation: $0.15/sq ft
  - Wall insulation: $0.10/sq ft
  - Heat pumps: $500/unit (baseline)

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### GitHub Pages Setup (Recommended)

1. **Create GitHub repository:**
   - Go to github.com and create new repo: `oregon-comprehensive-energy-app`
   - Make it public (for GitHub Pages)

2. **Push code:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/isaiah/oregon-comprehensive-energy-app
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/oregon-comprehensive-energy-app.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to repo Settings → Pages
   - Source: "Deploy from a branch"
   - Branch: `main` / `/ (root)`
   - Save

4. **Access your live site:**
   - URL will be: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/oregon-comprehensive-energy-app/`
   - Takes 1-2 minutes to deploy

### Alternative: Local Testing

```bash
# Option 1: Direct file open
open index.html

# Option 2: Local server (recommended for testing)
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Then visit: http://localhost:8000
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### Data Flow
1. **Intake** → Customer profile created, ID assigned
2. **Income** → Eligibility flags set based on thresholds
3. **Assessment** → Recommendations generated with costs/incentives
4. **Insights** → All data synthesized, incentives adjusted by eligibility

### State Management
- Global `appState` object tracks all data
- Persists throughout session (not between sessions)
- Each step validates before allowing progression
- Can navigate backward without data loss

### Key Functions
- `submitIntake()` - Captures customer data, generates ID
- `calculateIncome()` - Normalizes income, calculates percentages, determines eligibility
- `analyzeAssessment()` - Generates prioritized recommendations
- `showComprehensiveResults()` - Synthesizes everything into final plan
- `downloadReport()` - Exports standalone HTML report

## 📈 Customization Options

### Update Income Data
Edit the data objects in `index.html` around line 1013-1062:
```javascript
const oregonCounties = { ... }  // AMI by county
const fplData = { ... }         // Federal Poverty Guidelines
const oregonSMI = 78600;        // State Median Income
```

### Adjust Eligibility Thresholds
Modify logic in `calculateIncome()` around line 1190:
```javascript
appState.eligibilityResults = {
    liheap: percentages.fpl <= 150,           // Change threshold here
    weatherization: percentages.smi <= 60,    // etc.
    ...
}
```

### Update Incentive Calculations
Edit `generateRecommendations()` around line 1308:
```javascript
const incentive = sqft * 0.15;  // Change rates here
```

### Modify Styling
CSS variables at top of `<style>` section (line 9-22):
```css
:root {
    --brand: #2c5530;        /* Primary green */
    --brand-light: #5cb85c;  /* Secondary green */
    --accent: #3282b8;       /* Blue accent */
    ...
}
```
