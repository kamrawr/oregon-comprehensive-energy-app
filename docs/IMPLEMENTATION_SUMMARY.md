# Audit Recommendations - Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ ALL RECOMMENDATIONS IMPLEMENTED  
**Commits:** 3 (Audit Report, Critical Fixes, All Recommendations)

---

## Overview

Following the comprehensive data audit documented in `docs/AUDIT_REPORT.md`, all recommendations have been successfully implemented and tested.

---

## 🔴 Critical Issues FIXED

### 1. CPF Eligibility Threshold (CRITICAL)

**Issue:** Over-promising CPF eligibility to households 81-149% AMI

**Previous Code:**
```javascript
cpfEligible: percentages.ami < 150 && (isPriorityCommunity || workingWithCBO)
```

**Corrected Code:**
```javascript
// CORRECTED: CPF eligibility ≤80% AMI + (priority community OR CBO)
// Source: DATA_SOURCES.md line 179 | Energy Trust CPF program rules
// Previous incorrect threshold: <150% AMI (audit correction Oct 2025)
cpfEligible: !optOutFederal && percentages.ami <= 80 && (isPriorityCommunity || workingWithCBO)
```

**Impact:**
- Prevents over-promising to ~70% more households than actually eligible
- Aligns with official Energy Trust CPF documentation
- Reduces customer disappointment and program mistrust

**Location:** `index.html` line 1555  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED & TESTED

---

### 2. HEAR Low-Income Eligibility Gap (MEDIUM-HIGH)

**Issue:** Excluded weatherization-eligible customers (≤60% AMI) from HEAR options

**Previous Code:**
```javascript
hearLowIncome: percentages.ami > 60 && percentages.ami <= 80
```

**Corrected Code:**
```javascript
// CORRECTED: Include all ≤80% AMI (including weatherization tier ≤60%)
// Source: IRA Section 50122, incentive_eligibility_map.json line 43
// Rationale: Weatherization-eligible customers can choose HEAR if waitlist exists
hearLowIncome: !optOutFederal && percentages.ami <= 80
```

**Impact:**
- Weatherization-eligible customers now see HEAR as alternative option
- Critical for addressing weatherization program waitlists
- Provides choice between no-cost weatherization vs. faster HEAR rebates

**Location:** `index.html` line 1566  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED & TESTED

---

## ✅ Documentation Improvements IMPLEMENTED

### 3. Comprehensive Inline Code Comments

**Added:**
- Source references for all data points (HUD, HHS, OHCS, IRA)
- Links to official documentation
- Explanation of SMI vs AMI distinction
- Last verified dates
- Purpose and usage of each threshold

**Example:**
```javascript
// 2025 Area Median Income (AMI) by County
// Source: HUD Income Limits 2025 | oregon-income-calculator repo
// Reference: https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html
// Used for: Energy Trust, CPF, HEAR, HOMES eligibility
```

**Location:** Throughout `index.html` eligibility logic  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

### 4. Data Freshness Indicators Added to UI

**Income Module:**
```
Using 2025 Data: HUD Income Limits, HHS Poverty Guidelines | Last verified: Oct 29, 2025
```

**Footer:**
```
Last Verified: October 29, 2025 | Data Version: 1.1 | Next Review: December 2025
```

**Benefits:**
- Increases user trust and transparency
- Makes it clear data is current
- Sets expectations for next update

**Location:** `index.html` lines 952-954 (income module), 1309-1312 (footer)  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## 🧪 Validation & Testing COMPLETED

### 5. Comprehensive Test Suite Created

**Test File:** `tests/eligibility-validation.test.js`  
**Test Count:** 8 edge cases  
**Current Status:** 8/8 PASSING ✅

**Edge Cases Tested:**
1. ✅ 60% AMI - Weatherization boundary
2. ✅ 80% AMI - CPF/HEAR cutoff
3. ✅ 81% AMI - Above CPF threshold (should fail CPF)
4. ✅ 150% AMI - HEAR moderate cutoff
5. ✅ 151% AMI - Standard programs only
6. ✅ 80% AMI without priority - CPF requires priority/CBO
7. ✅ Federal opt-out - Filters federal programs correctly
8. ✅ 200% FPL via SMI - Weatherization via FPL path

**Test Output:**
```
🧪 Running Eligibility Validation Tests
================================================================================
📊 Test Summary:
   ✅ Passed: 8/8
   ❌ Failed: 0/8
🎉 All tests passed!
```

**Run Tests:**
```bash
node tests/eligibility-validation.test.js
```

**Documentation:** `tests/README.md`  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## 📚 Documentation Updates COMPLETED

### 6. DATA_SOURCES.md Updated

**Added:**
- "Corrections and Updates" section documenting fixes
- Updated eligibility table with correction notes
- Incremented version from 1.0 to 1.1 (post-corrections)
- Cross-references to test suite and audit report

**Key Changes:**
- CPF threshold now shows: `≤80% AMI + Priority Community/CBO | **CORRECTED Oct 2025** (was <150%)`
- HEAR low-income now shows: `≤80% AMI | **Includes weatherization tier**`

**Location:** `docs/DATA_SOURCES.md` lines 179, 267-291  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## Impact Assessment

### Before Fixes
- ❌ CPF over-promised to 81-149% AMI (~70% overreach)
- ❌ Weatherization customers couldn't see HEAR alternatives
- ⚠️ No inline documentation or source references
- ⚠️ No data freshness indicators
- ❌ No automated testing for eligibility logic

### After Fixes
- ✅ CPF correctly limited to ≤80% AMI
- ✅ All ≤80% AMI see HEAR options (including weatherization tier)
- ✅ Comprehensive inline documentation with sources
- ✅ Clear data freshness indicators in UI
- ✅ Automated test suite with 100% pass rate
- ✅ Full audit trail and documentation

---

## Maintenance Recommendations

### Regular Updates
- **Quarterly:** Run test suite before/after any eligibility changes
- **Annually:** Update income data (AMI, SMI, FPL) in March/April
- **As Needed:** Update when programs announce threshold changes

### Test Suite Maintenance
- Add new test cases when edge cases are discovered
- Update expected values when thresholds officially change
- Run tests in CI/CD pipeline (future enhancement)

### Documentation Maintenance
- Update DATA_SOURCES.md when data changes
- Record all threshold corrections in "Corrections and Updates" section
- Maintain version numbering (increment on data updates)

- ✅ Correct eligibility thresholds matching official program rules
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation and source references
- ✅ Data freshness indicators for user trust
