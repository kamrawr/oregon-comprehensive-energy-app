- ✅ 7 utility options total:
  - **Electric:** PGE, Pacific Power, EWEB, Municipal
  - **Gas:** NW Natural, Cascade, Avista, Propane
- ✅ Form validation: Must select ≥1 electric utility
- ✅ Data structure: `electricUtilities[]`, `gasUtilities[]`, `allUtilities[]`
- ✅ Visual styling with icons and grouped panels

### 2. Drag-and-Drop Priority Ranking ✅
**File:** `index.html` (HTML + CSS + JavaScript)

**Features:**
- ✅ Interactive drag-and-drop interface for customer concerns
- ✅ Visual card design with emojis (💰 🌡️ 💨 🔧 🏠 🪟 ⚠️)
- ✅ Two-panel layout:
  - Left: Available Concerns pool
  - Right: Priority Ranking area (gradient background)
- ✅ Full drag-and-drop functionality:
  - Drag from pool → ranking
  - Reorder within ranking
  - Drag back to pool to remove
- ✅ Auto-ranking with numbered badges (#1, #2, #3...)
- ✅ Weight calculation: Top priority = 7, descending to 1
- ✅ Data capture: `{ id, icon, text, rank, weight }`
- ✅ Report integration: Shows ranked concerns with badges
- ✅ Empty state messaging
- ✅ Hover and drag visual states

**JavaScript Functions:**
- `initializeDragAndDrop()` - Sets up event listeners
- `handleDragStart/End/Over/Drop()` - Drag event handlers
- `updatePriorityRanks()` - Recalculates ranks after changes
- `getPrioritizedConcerns()` - Extracts ranked data for submission

### 3. Demo Data Loader ✅
**File:** `index.html`

  - #3: Old Equipment (🔧)
- ✅ Sets housing type, ownership, urgency
- ✅ Confirmation alert on load
- ✅ Perfect for demos and testing

### 4. Incentive Calculation Engine ✅
**File:** `src/incentive_calculator.js` (630 lines)

**Class:** `IncentiveCalculator`

**Core Methods:**
- `calculateAvailableIncentives()` - Main entry point
- `determineEligiblePrograms()` - Checks income, utilities, geography
- `generateRecommendations()` - Creates measure list based on assessment
- `calculateMeasureIncentives()` - Calculates incentives per measure
- `getMeasureIncentive()` - Gets specific program incentive amounts
- `optimizeIncentiveStacking()` - Finds best incentive combinations

**Program Logic:**
- ✅ **HOMES (IRA)** - Modeled savings rebate (up to $8,000)
- ✅ **HEAR (IRA)** - High-efficiency appliance rebates (up to $14,000)
  - Income-based: 100% for ≤80% AMI, 50% for 81-150% AMI
- ✅ **CPF (Energy Trust)** - Income-qualified enhanced incentives
- ✅ **Energy Trust Standard** - Standard prescriptive incentives
- ✅ **SWR (Weatherization)** - Comprehensive no-cost services
- ✅ **CERTA** - Property tax exemption (stacks with all)
- ✅ **Utility-specific** - PGE, NW Natural programs

**Recommendation Engine:**
- ✅ Priority system: Health/Safety > Customer Priority > Envelope > HVAC
- ✅ Integrates customer's prioritized concerns with weights
- ✅ Generates measure-specific recommendations
- ✅ Calculates costs, savings, payback periods
- ✅ Simplified Manual J sizing for heat pumps

**Stacking Optimization:**
- ✅ Checks program compatibility rules
- ✅ Identifies mutually exclusive programs (HOMES vs HEAR)
